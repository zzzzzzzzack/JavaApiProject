# JavaApiProject

I want a project to test not only my ability to code and to freshen up syntax, but to challenge my ability to architect a project.

The problem should be able to start small but have potential scaling implications to think about.

Test driven development would be nice, but I don't really know what I am building yet.

Something to test performance would be nice.

front end testing frameworks like selenium or cypress would be nice.

database architecture is difficult for me and would be great to learn.

Github actions to create pipelines or seomthing of the sort for devops would be nice.

learning to use the copilot prompt better would be nice.

Security stuff?
